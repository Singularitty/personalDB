/**
 * personalDB
 * Program to help you manage files in your personal computer and in between servers/cloud storage
 * This was made because I was tired of managing files between my laptop, desktop, server and cloud
 * Right now it's just a simple file explorer, but I hope to add database like features, such as
 * storing files in an efficient way and retrieving then using hashes and some algorithms
 * This is a personal project designed to expand my knowledge in these areas of computing and not
 * meant to be anything serious or even useful
