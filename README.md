 ## personalDB
 
 ### \- Very early prototype, not working \-
 
Program to help you manage files in your personal computer and in between servers/cloud storage  

This was made because I was tired of managing files between my laptop, desktop, server and cloud  
 
Right now it's just a simple file explorer, but I hope to add database like features, such as
storing files and data in an efficient way and retrieving then using hashes and some algorithms  

This is a personal project designed to expand my knowledge in these areas of computing and not
meant to be anything serious or even useful  


#### Status
- Help command and menu working
- Basic file explorer features (Managing directories and files, also openning files with default application supported)

#### To do
- Add file searching functionality
- Finish OperationEngine
- File control logic
- Build a usable terminal interface

#### Known issues
- Cannot cd parse pathnames that include escape character \ and quotation marks " (e.g.: \"random directory" (Only on windows)
